# Piano Clone
Do you remember the famous game you played as a kid, with showering piano tiles on which you have to tap to score? What does a developer do, when they're bored and want to play games? That's right, ~~they develop their own games~~ they clone an existing game. Well presenting a clone of the famous _Piano Tiles_, built using Flutter. This clone does not have any added features(I'm afraid it lacks some, oops!), but it sure brings the very essence of the game. Tapping the tiles and scoring high. Clone and enjoy.
